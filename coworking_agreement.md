## Accessibility Needs
We agreed that we openly share our info, progress, links including links to cloned repo and link to final version. 

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
We decided to work in collaboration - we take time to investigate task and think about our ideas and implementation (peace of code) separatly and after it we will come together and discuss it. Main channel for us is Slack. 
Wave 1 and wave 2 until 09/23 - we will discuss it on Tuesday from 1 to 2pm. 
Wave 3 and 4 (5?) Wednesday meeting will be from 4 to 5. 
Wave 5 Thursday.

## Learning Style
We will take time to investigate the task and think about our ideas and implementation (pieces of code) separately, and afterwards we will come together to discuss them.

## Preferred Feedback Style
Small issues will be resolve via verbal communication. 
Big issues will be resolve via direct Slack message. 

We prefer direct style of communication.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
Explain code clearly to team member. 

## Optional: Other agreements
Let's have fun and try to enjoy the process.
